# Bullet Heck for Unity
Bullet Heck is a 2D  bullet pattern system for Unity. The bullet system is BYOB (bring your own bullets) so you can integrate this into existing games and continue to use your bullet prefabs.

The system is data driven and procedurally builds shape and bullet patterns based on parameterized scriptable objects. Since the data containers are scriptable objects they can be updated at runtime and Unity will make sure they are serialized properly.
